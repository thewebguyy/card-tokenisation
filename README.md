# card-tokenisation
This repository contains a simple Flask app that implements card tokenization. The app takes a POST request with the card details as JSON data, and then makes a request to the SeerBit API to tokenize the card. If the tokenization is successful, the app returns the token as a JSON response. Otherwise, the app returns an error message.
